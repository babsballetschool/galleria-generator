# galleria-generator
Galleria JSON generator, written in Elm.

[Galleria][galleria] is a

> free JavaScript image gallery framework that simplifies the process
> of creating beautiful image galleries for the web and mobile devices.

It relies on a [JSON][json] file describing the images in the gallery 
and their titles and descriptions. Editing JSON manually is a chore.
This project aims to provide a easy to use generator for said JSON file.
